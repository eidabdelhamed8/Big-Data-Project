                        <p class="adress">Structured data</p>    
                        <p class="tt">Structured data is used in an structured fashion to refer to data already stored in databases. It accounts for around 20% of all existing data and is most used in programming and computer-related activities.<br> 
                        There are two types of organized data- and human-machines. All the data obtained from sensors, weblogs and financial systems are known as data generated by machines.These include medical devices, GPS data, usage statistics data captured by servers and applications, and the enormous amount of data typically moving through trading platforms, to name a few.<br> Human-generated structured data mainly includes all data, such as his name and other personal details, a human input into a computer.When a person clicks a connection on the internet or even moves in a game, data is created â€” this can be used by companies to assess their consumer actions and make the correct decisions and adjustments.</p>
                        <p class="adres">Unstructured data</p>   
                        <p class="tt">While structured data resides in traditional row-column databases, unstructured data is the opposite-in storage they do not have a clear format. The rest of the data created for unstructured big data, about 80 per cent of the total account. Much of the data a person experiences belong to this group- and there wasn't anything to do with it until recently except to store it or manually analyze it.<br>Additionally, unstructured data is categorized into machine-generated or human-generated data depending on its source. All the satellite images, the experimental data from various experiments and the radar data collected by various aspects of technology are accounted for by computer generated data.<br>Human-generated unstructured data are contained in abundance in the internet, as it includes social media data, smartphone data and material on the website. This means that the photos we upload to the handle of Facebook or Instagram, the videos we watch on YouTube, and even the text messages we send all add to the gigantic heap of unstructured information.</p> 
                        <p class="ad">Semi-structured data</p>  
                        <p class="tt">Since most semi-structured data appear to be unstructured at a glance, the line between unstructured data and semi-structured data has always been unclear. Included in semi-structured data is information that is not in the traditional database format as structured data, but contains some organizational properties that make it easier to process.NoSQL documents, for example, are considered semi-structured, since they contain keywords that can be used to easily process the document.<br>Application of big data has been found to have significant economic benefit, as its application and processing will help a company achieve cost savings and drastic growth. So it's imperative you don't wait too long to harness the potential of this great business opportunity.</p>
