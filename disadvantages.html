                <p class="def">Disadvantages of Big Data</p>
                <p>On the other side of the equation, many companies have also reported significant challenges when implementing big data analytics initiatives. Reported disadvantages of big data include the following:</p>
                <p class="adress">Need for talent</p>
                <p class="tt">Data scientists and Big Data specialists are among the most desirable – and highly paid – IT-field workers. The AtScale survey found that for the past three years the absence of a Big Data skill set has been the number one big data challenge. And the respondents in the Syncsort survey rated expertise and personnel as the second-largest obstacle when building a data lake. Hiring or educating workers can dramatically raise costs and the process of developing big data expertise can take a substantial period of time.</p>
                <p class="adres">Data quality</p>
                <p class="tt">The number one downside of dealing with big data in the Syncsort survey was the need to address data quality problems. Data scientists and analysts need to ensure that the information they are using is accurate , relevant and in the correct format for analysis before they can use big data for analytics efforts. This significantly delays the reporting process, but if businesses do not fix data quality problems, they will find that the insights produced by their analytics are worthless — or even negative if they act upon them.</p>
                <p class="adre">Cybersecurity risks</p>
                <p class="tt">Saving big data , particularly sensitive data, may make companies a more enticing target for cyber-attackers. In the AtScale study , respondents have consistently identified protection as one of big data's biggest challenges, and executives rated cybersecurity breaches as the single greatest data danger facing their companies in the NewVantage research.</p>
                <p class="adr">Hardware needs</p>
                <p class="tt">Another significant problem for organizations is the IT infrastructure required to support initiatives in the field of big data analysis. Buying and maintaining storage space to house the data, networking bandwidth to move it to and from analytics systems, and computing resources to perform those analytics are all costly. When using cloud-based analytics, some companies can mitigate this problem, but it typically does not remove the technology problems entirely.</p>
                <p class="ad">Costs</p>
                <p class="tt">Many of today's big data tools rely on open source technology, which dramatically reduces software costs, but businesses still face substantial personnel, hardware, maintenance and related services expenses. Big data analytics projects are not unusual to run considerably over budget and take longer to deploy than IT administrators had originally expected.</p>
