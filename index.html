                <p>Big data is a broad term for the non-traditional strategies and technologies required for gathering , organizing, storing, and gathering insights from large datasets. Although the issue of dealing with data that exceeds a single computer's processing power or storage is not new, this form of processing's omnipresence, size, and value has grown greatly in recent years.</p>
                <p class="def">Big Data Defination</p>
                <p>It's difficult to pin down an exact concept of "big data" as it's used very differently by ventures, suppliers, practitioners and business professionals. With that in mind, the big data is generally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>large datasets.</li>
                    <li>the category of computing strategies and technologies that are used to handle large datasets.</li>
                    <p>Within this context, "big dataset" means a dataset too big to fairly process or store on a single device or with conventional tooling. This means that big data sets' common scale is constantly shifting and can vary significantly from organization to organization.</p>
