                <p class="adress">Volume</p>
                <P class="tt">Volume refers to the incredible amounts of information created every second from social media , mobile phones, vehicles, credit cards, M2 M sensors, photos , video and everything else. We are currently using distributed systems, storing data at different locations, and developing a software platform such as Hadoop.<br>Facebook alone can produce about a billion tweets, 4.5 billion times the "like" button is clicked, and more than 350 million new posts are posted daily. Only Big Data Technology can accommodate this massive amount of data</P>
                <p class="adress">Velocity</p>
                <P class="tt">Last but not least, pace plays a major role in comparison with the others, there's no point in spending too much to end up waiting for the results. So, Big Dat's main aspect is providing data on demand and at a faster pace.</P>
                <p class="adress">Variety</p>
                <P class="tt">Big Data is generated in several varieties, as discussed earlier. Contrary to conventional data such as telephone numbers and addresses, the new data pattern is in the form of images, videos and audios and many more, making about 80 % of the data totally unstructured.</P>
                <p class="adress">Value</p>
                <P class="tt">Price is the major thing that we need to concentrate on. It is not about the quantity of data we store or process. It is actually the amount of useful, accurate, and trustworthy data that needs to be stored, processed, analyzed for insights to be found.</P>
                <p class="adress">Veracity</p>
                <P class="tt">Veracity simply means the degree of reliability the data have to offer. Since a large part of the data is unstructured and meaningless, Big Data needs to find an alternative way to process or interpret it as the data is critical in the growth of business.</P>
