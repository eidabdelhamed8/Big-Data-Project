                <p class="def">Advantages of Big Data</p>
                <p>The vast majority of businesses say the benefits of big data are important. 73.2 per cent of executives said they had seen tangible market results from their activities in the NewVantage Partners study. Furthermore, "Those executives who replied 'no' think it is too early to say what effect these investments would have on their business".<br>So what are those benefits?<br>Enterprises report multiple advantages of big data, including the following:</p>
                <p class="adress">Better decision-making</p>
                <p class="tt">In the NewVantage Partners survey, 36.2 percent of respondents said that the number one goal of their big data analytics activities was to make better decisions. Additionally, 84.1 percent had started working towards that target, and 59.0 percent had achieved any tangible success, for a 69.0 percent overall success rate. Analytics can offer the data-driven insights that business decision-makers need to help their businesses thrive and expand.</p>
                <p class="adres">Reduce costs</p>
                <p class="tt">Both the surveys conducted by Syncsort and NewVantage showed that big data analytics helped businesses slash their expenses. Nearly six out of ten (59.4 percent) respondents told Syncsort Big Data Tools had helped them improve operational productivity and cut costs, and almost two-thirds (66.7 percent) of NewVantage survey respondents said they had started to use Big Data to reduce costs. Interestingly, however, just 13.0 percent of respondents selected cost savings as their primary goal for big data analytics, indicating that this is merely a convenient side benefit for others.</p>
                <p class="adre">Improved customer service</p>
                <p class="tt">Improving customer satisfaction was the second most common primary target for Big Data Analytics ventures among respondents to the NewVantage survey, and 53.4 per cent of organizations had some success in this regard. Social networking, customer relationship management ( CRM) systems and other customer touch points provide today's businesses a wealth of knowledge about their customers, and it is only reasonable that they should use this data to serve those customers better.</p>
                <p class="adr">Increased revenue</p>
                <p class="tt">As companies use big data to enhance their decision making and their customer support, the expected result is also increased revenue. More than half of respondents (54.7 per cent) said in the Syncsort survey that they used big data tools to increase sales and boost growth based on better insights.</p>
                <p class="ad">Greater innovation</p>
                <p class="tt">Another important advantage of big data is creativity, and the NewVantage survey showed that 11.6 per cent of executives invest in analytics mainly as a way of innovating and changing their markets. They claim that if they can gather information that their rivals don't have, with new products and services they can be able to get ahead of the rest of the industry.</p>
